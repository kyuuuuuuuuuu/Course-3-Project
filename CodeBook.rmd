3. For each record it is provided:
    - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
    - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
    - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
    - Its activity label. 
    - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

4. The column names are tidied. You can check the original info about features at features_info.txt
